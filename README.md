## Basketball
**Basketball is, in my opinion, the best activity I can engage in with my buddies to have fun and expend some energy.** Instead of spending the entire day on the couch playing video games or watching television, I think that playing basketball is a pleasant and simple way to pass the time. **Basketball is one of my favorite sports since you can play it alone or with teammates and you don't need any equipment.** I like playing with other people more than I like playing by myself.
